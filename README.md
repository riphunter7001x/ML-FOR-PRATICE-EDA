# ML-FOR-PRATICE+EDA
This repository contains code examples and datasets for machine learning practice with a focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA). The code examples cover various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering, and demonstrate how to perform EDA to gain insights into the datasets.

# Requirements
To run the code examples, you will need to have the following software installed:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python packages 

# Datasets
The repository includes several datasets that can be used for machine learning practice. Each dataset is stored in a separate directory and comes with a README file that provides details about the dataset.

# Code Examples
The code examples are organized into separate directories based on the machine learning task they perform (e.g., classification, regression, clustering). Each directory contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the code and provides explanations of the techniques used.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a code example or a dataset that you would like to add, please create a pull request.
